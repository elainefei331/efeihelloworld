                        <p>5. Lacking fiber-digesting bacteria causes panda bears to defecate as much as 28 kilograms a day. It seems they are just eating, sleeping, and pooping all day. That’s one of the reasons they are endangered today as humans can find them easily by tracking their feces.</p>

                    <p>10. Similar habitats and diets make some experts believe that giant pandas and red pandas are the same species. However, according to a scientific test, the red panda belongs to the raccoon family while the giant panda is part of the bear family. </p>

                        <p>4. To eat easily, pandas’ six “fingers” help them grasp and maneuver bamboo. Like other bears, giant pandas have plantigrade feet so they can walk like humans and their entire foot touches the ground when walking.</p>
